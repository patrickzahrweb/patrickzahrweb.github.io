                            Daring contrasts and different textures all while finding a certain
                            homogeneity, revisiting the classics, crossing the eras. For his creations,
                            Patrick Zahr diverts the established codes with an ingenuous spirit and a lot
                            of lightness. He therefore marks his chic and spontaneous style with a
                            modern elegance and a natural fluidity. Through his creations, the body is
                            structured by graphic lines, sensuality is suggested by movement.
                            In a country filled with contrasts and elegance Lebanon, Patrick was born and
                            raised in a small millennial Phoenician town on the Mediterranean coast, a
                            short distance from Bayreuth. From a young age, Patrick is fascinated and
                            attracted to textures and colors, by meticulous craftsmanship. He marked his
                            professors by his drawings and his creativity. In Bayreuth, he started his
                            career as an interior designer where he constantly searched to recreate a
                            unique universe for each of his clients to feel good, from Bayreuth to
                            Montreal. Patrick work little for others, self-taught, he prefers to learn by
                            himself through his experiences.
                            He now expresses himself by fashion design through what makes him feel
                            alive and animated: far from the established codes, he creates his own
                            universe with freedom and natural and fresh modernism, at the service of
                            women and men that he meets and that he loves to magnify. Patrick Zahr
                            creates his own label under his own name, a hybrid identity where the oriental
                            softness and beauty irrigate a western style and brings him a refreshing
                            breeze of the Orient. His workshop elaborates from noble fabrics and fabrics
                            with ethnic character with modern and precise silhouettes all at once, like a
                            heritage of his training as an interior architectural designer that marks his
                            comprehension of fashion. His influences are a mix of his Lebanese origins,
                            his adoptive Canada and his numerous trips to Paris, a source of so many
                            inspirations and breaths.
